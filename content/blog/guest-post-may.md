## Two days with Helen

I spent two days working alongside Helen, so that I could grasp what Digital Transformation means and to see what Leadership in a start-up feels like. Why did I do this? Well, I work as Head of IT for a military charity and I am currently undertaking a 6 month Clore Leadership Programme, a key element of which is to undertake a placement. My mentor (another element of the programme) suggested Helen and put me in touch, when I explained to him that I wanted a better understanding of Digital Transformation.

I have to admit it was an intense experience, with Helen and I sitting together in the meeting room of the shared office space she uses near Blackfriars.

The first day started with a conference call with a disability charity that Helen is working with. I could see that Helen had gained their trust and they were ready to get going as soon Helen could help them with accessing some funding. After the call we had a good discussion on the challenges and opportunities for the charity.

Throughout the two days Helen would give me a nugget of knowledge about an aspect of Digital and I would take the opportunity to ask questions. This helped me to deepen my understanding of the area.

During the two days I was working on a project that Helen had started on. By undertaking some desk based research and looking through what she had already pulled together I was able to outline the bare bones of an implementation plan for the project. The project revolves around creating an infrastructure for small charities so that they can develop their digital capabilities.

I gained a great insight into Helen&#39;s passion for digital and supporting small charities and I really hope that Innovation Unboxed really takes off! Small charities need the support.

# Statement

What I gained from my placement?

I now have a full grasp of what Digital and Digital Transformation means. I also understand some of the techniques used to deliver Digital Transformation such as Human Centric Design and Agile methodologies.

Helen outlined some of the work that she has undertaken and this further highlighted how expanding digital activities within charities can help them deliver more with less, and in some cases ensure they are sustainable.
